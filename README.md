### Unsatisfied Customer Needs

Customers often states that if they had more information at the point of purchase, they would more often purchase sustainable products. However, brands/stores struggle to provide this information. Now, QRTailor App uses effective medium communication to target this customer needs  and promote sustainability in easy ways:

* By directly providing material details, customers are able to know about the sustanable level of the product quickly and clearly
* With more information (e.g. colours) and alternatives provided, consumer can do decision rationally and prevent impulse shopping

### Monetized B2B Commerce

With QRTailor's target customers being large retail/clothing stores (e.g. Nike), our app breaks the wall between the consumer and the business, and allows the true nature of the products to be transparent. This makes QRTailor appealing to its customers (businesses) as it targets their core needs and provide unique benefits:

* Businesses are able to be certifivcated as an ethical and eco-friendly companies with the use of this product, helping them maintaining and promoting Corporate Social Responsibility
* This also shows that they are actually putting the customer first. They might lose money in the short term; however, they are more likely to get more shares and revenues in the long term because of the increased reputation
*  Also, according to data, a company’s profit actually decreases when the returns and damaged items increase due to the increased cost in customer service and cost of sales. Well, QRTailor is able to decrease the number of returns to a large extent, which helps companies increase their profit. Therefore, QRTailor targets its customers’ (businesses) needs and is promisingly monetized.
