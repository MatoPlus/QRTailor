### What It Is

​		QR Code scanner app used by employees to instantly extract additional information from a specific product regarding its feature (e.g. stock number, available colours, reviews).

### How We Made It

​		QRTailor is an android app built on Android Studio. WIth the use of Firebase, we are able to read and interpret the QR Code. Futrthermore, we made an API call and hosted a local server with the front-end framework Flask written in Python. As for our database, our raw data mainly came from .json file, which was parsed through an API called org.json in Android Studio. 

​		What's more, we also created a Figma program that details how our ideal program would look like with an advanced GUI (graphic user interface).

### How It Can Make Us

​		As a B2B conmmerce, with QRTailor's target consumers being large retail/clothing stores (e.g. Nike), our app narrows the information gap between the employees and the business, and allows information about the products to be transparent through employees. This makes QRTailor appealing to businesses as it targets their wants and provide unique benefits:

* Businesses are able to be viewed as honest companies with the use of this product, helping them maintain and promote corporate social responsibility.
* This also shows that businesses are actually putting the customer first. The businesses are likely increase revenue as better customer service and easier shopping for the customer results in larger customer base
